# Plutus Pioneer Program (2nd Cohort)
## The Notes and Thoughts of a Joyous Pioneer

---

## What is this? 🖋

**Why** do we study if not for the *benefit of others*? A field of study only has its merits as much as its followers. This series of documents containing my *notes and thoughts over the Plutus Pioneer Program* attempts to create an active discussion about what we are learning together. 

We are all treading on a skeletal bridge(that we know is a strong one! 😆) at the moment, and to add the necessary reinforcements and pavements, it's on all of us to hold hand to hand and work together towards the same goal🌉!

This is merely one man's interpretation of what he learnt over the course, there's going to be areas that I misunderstood, and there might be areas that enlighten a part of the reader's knowledge! What I'd like for this repository (on top of the discord server) is **to be an area where many issues pop up, from small things to typos to significant existential questions relating to the course!** 

Every idea, every thought, no matter how trivial or complex, deserves respect, and may it flourish through this space!

- The plan is to **update the notes every weekend after the lectures**, but it will depend on my personal schedule!

- Notes will be uploaded in pdf formats in two versions: **one in English🇬🇧, and the other in Korean🇰🇷**. I'm not sure whether my English is better or my Korean(I do write in English first, then translate to Korean so..), so if you do find mistakes, typos, or errors in expression in any of the languages, please add an issue about it!

- The .tex files that I wrote up to render the pdfs will also be uploaded, and anyone can make it into their own!

Bring up a lot of issues, and Share the love! ❤

## Who am I? 👨‍💻

Some Random Facts about me includes:

- I'm currently a Lead Deep Learning Research Engineer based in Seoul, but leaving work soon (Sept 2021) to really focus on my personal interests.
- Originally from South Korea but have spent most of my teenage and university years in the UK.
- Studied Mathematics during my time at University, with a particular focus on Mathematical Epidemiology.
- Proud Cardano Stake Pool Operator of the Gestalt Pool, Ticker: [**GEST**](https://twitter.com/gestaltpool)
- Some of my many interests are: Viral epidemiology modelling, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Decentralised systems, and especially my favorite blockchain Cardano!
- There's a million things I haven't done, but just you wait, just you wait! 😉

## Support me! 🤟

If you found this repository helpful, please **show your support by sharing it with other fellow pioneers** or anybody else who might be interested!

As written above, I am a Stake pool operator running the Gestalt Stake Pool (GEST). It's a baby pool at the moment, but I hope it can grow soon! If you'd like, please support the decentralisation of the Cardano network by staking with small, dedicated, single pool operated, and mission-driven pools like **GEST**.

For us, every precious delegation counts! We at GEST plan to use the pool rewards in creating awesome games and services that will run on top-of or hybrid with the Cardano Blockchain. What you receive from the community, you give back, right? We want to be part of that beautiful cycle. Even at this moment, we're preparing a cool Deep RL based game that will work on the browser once smart contracts are mainstreamed!

If anybody wants to have a discussion, chat, or even meet up(if you're in South Korea(Seoul)), please DM me on Twitter!
